What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I think it includes the files in the folder in the repository. It's required to have those
files available to commit

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do 
you think it offers?
The staging area is more of a snapshot of the files as you want them to be committed. The working 
directory is more of a version of the last snapshot that you are currently modifying that will be
later staged before committing. The value it adds is that you can prepare your files exactly as 
you want them for the next commit. (Craft commits exactly how you want them)

What are some situations whe branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How
would branches help?
Branches are useful to try experimental features without jeopardizing the main project. You can
do this in parallel and then merge files if you are happy/satisfied with the new features.
