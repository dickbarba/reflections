When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
WHenever you are colaborating with other programmers and need a common space to keep the
progress of the projetc in one place. Also if you know that you might be working from 
different computers on you project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you keep control of what you want to update. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of projects inside Github, clones are copies also but from Github to local repositories, while branches are commits inside a project that depart from the master branch.
