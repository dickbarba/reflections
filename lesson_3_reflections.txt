When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
WHenever you are colaborating with other programmers and need a common space to keep the
progress of the projetc in one place. Also if you know that you might be working from 
different computers on you project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you keep control of what you want to update.
